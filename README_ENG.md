# 🧠 ai-vector-db

Vector database built in **Python** for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings generated by LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI), it ingests any devops-ai-lab repo readme (used in jenkins auto-pr pipelie).

`devops-ai-lab`.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Centralize semantic information storage and enable advanced semantic searches using language models.
Acts as semantic memory accessible by microservices and LangChain agents via a simple REST API.

---

## 🔧 Features

* Embedding storage and retrieval.
* Advanced semantic search based on vector similarity.
* Simple REST API exposure.
